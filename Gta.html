  <div id="text"><mark><j><p><b>Grand Theft Auto V is a video game developed by Rockstar North. It is the fifteenth installment in the Grand Theft Auto series and the successor of Grand Theft Auto IV. The original edition was released on September 17th, 2013 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions were released on November 18th, 2014, and was later released on April 14th, 2015 for the PC. A further enhanced version for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X was announced in 2020, and is expected to release in fall of 2021.
	  The original edition was announced on October 25th, 2011; the game's first trailerwas released on Novemwber 2nd, 2011. The game was initially slated for a Spring 2013 release and there were even posters printed saying this but was delayed until September 17th the same year. Then, on July 15th, 2013, Rockstar announced the Japanese release date for the game: October 10th, 2013, almost a month after it was released in the Western world. The enhanced edition was announced on June 9th, 2014, with pre-orders made available on June 10.
	  Grand Theft Auto V is set circa 2013 in the city of Los Santos and its surrounding areas and tells the stories of three protagonists: Michael De Santa, Franklin Clinton, and Trevor Philips. It takes place about five years after the events of Grand Theft Auto IV.
	  As one of the most awaited video game titles to be released in 2013, the game was widely anticipated prior to its release. Grand Theft Auto V was released to universal acclaim, holding scores of 96 and above on MetaCritic and GameRankings, as well as receiving perfect scores from over 30 reviewers. The game sold 11,210,000 copies and grossed $800,000,000 on its first day of release, setting many records, and eventually making $1,000,000,000 within 3 days of the game's release.</mark></b><j></p></div>

Grand Theft Auto V features three playable protagonists: Michael, Trevor and Franklin.Michael is a retired professional bank robber, who after making a sweet deal with the FIB, returned to the life of crime. Trevor is the loose cannon in this story and is also a long time best friend of Michael's and a hothead psychopath as well. Last but certainly not least, we have Franklin, a young and grim repossession agent who has a large amount of experience behind the wheel, but no real experience with a crime until he meets Michael while he was trying to hustle.Each protagonists' character was made to fit a specific Grand Theft Auto player.Michael initially represents the player who has already "beat the game", now living out their life as a successfully retired, wealthy criminal.Trevor is a complete psychopath, representing the type of player who prefers to kill people and cause chaos when they free roam.Franklin is a small time thug wanting to rise through the ranks of the criminal underworld similar to the traditional protagonists that the player controls in previous games.Grand Theft Auto V evolves nearly every mechanic that was in the previous Grand Theft Auto games. As far as driving goes, the vehicles have been greatly improved, with Rockstar running more complex physics on them, such as making some cars hold to the ground slightly better. The driving mechanics feel more like a racing game, particularly the Midnight Club series, compared to Grand Theft Auto IV's rocky, boat-like handling system. The shooting mechanics are better in terms of the feel of the mechanics and larger compared to the melee mechanics in the game, that being said, melee has been improved over the previous titles as well. Weapon selection has now also been changed. Instead of the old way of selecting through all the weapons sequentially, there is now a Weapon Wheel, which is similar to the one featured in Red Dead Redemption, another game made by Rockstar Games.<j></p></b></div>
