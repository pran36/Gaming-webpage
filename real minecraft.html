<p><b> Minecraft is the brainchild of the Swedish programmer Markus "Notch" Persson who previously worked at the video game developers King and later jAlbum. Before laying all of his focus on Minecraft, Notch developed a few prototypes during his off-hours, inspired by popular games at the time. Among the prototypes were RubyDung, a base-building game, and Infiniminer, a block-based mining game. 
<br/>
<br/>
The first edition of Minecraft, called Java Edition, was made by Notch during a weekend in early May 2009. The game was initially released to the public in May 17 on the TIGSource forum, a forum for Independent game developers. After feedback from his peers, Notch updated the game to, which nowadays is called, the Classic version. A few more updates were released during the next couple of months, the Indev and Infdevs versions, before the first major update, Alpha, was released June 30 2010. It was around this time that Minecraft was beginning to pick up speed.
<br/>
<br/>
Notch quit his daytime job to solely focus on Minecraft. With the money earned from the game, he founded the now legendary video game company Mojang, together with his previous colleagues Carl Manneh and Jakob Porser. At this time, Minecraft was constantly updated and calibrated. New items, blocks, mobs, resources, game mechanics - and the much loved Survival Mode was added. In December 30, Minecraft entered the Beta-phase. In preparation for the full release, Mojang hired new employees as the game, and the amount of people who played it, grew at a rapid pace.</b></p>

<h2><b>A vision takes over the world</b></h2>
<p><b>The full version of Minecraft was released on the 18 November 2011. And it was an immediate success. From this time on, Minecraft was really only heading one way. And that way was up. To focus on the direction of the game and taking a more overall lead, Notch stepped down as the Lead Designer and hired Jens "Jeb" Bergensten, who took full creative control of the game.

	<br/>
	As the player base grew, so did Mojang. Tying up deals with more partners and developers was a must to support and push the limit of the ever increasing Minecraft. Over the next couple of years, several new editions and updates came out, including the "Adventure Update", "Pretty Scary Update" and "The Update that Changed the World". Slicker design, more types of mobs, biomes, objectives, items and game mechanics were added. One of the biggest allures of Minecraft was that it was constantly changing and updated - with more things to do and experience. Nothing has changed to this day.
	<br/>
	<br/>
Minecraft continued to develop and added more of literally everything. Boss fights, a much larger underground element, additional dimensions and areas. The game was introduced to various new consoles and platforms during the years. Xbox, Playstation, Nintendo, the Pocket Edition for mobile. Even virtual reality got a piece of the Minecraft cake.</b></p>

<h2><b> Gamemodes </b></h2>
<p><b>Gamers play Minecraft for a variety of reasons - all with different goals and aims. Some like to focus on building amazing things in Creative Mode - the Eiffel Tower and Taj Mahal is among the ambitious creations. Some like to survive on the highest difficulty as long as possible in Survival Mode or Hardcore Mode. Some want to discover all the secrets and Easter eggs and some want a more story-based adventure in Adventure Mode. There're tons of things to do!
<br/>
<br/>
Minecraft is also highly customizable. The modding community has made a wide variety of new maps, mobs, items - everything you can think of! Another aspect of Minecraft is the Multiplayer Mode where several players can meet and play in a single world. Surviving by fighting off mobs and build stuff together sounds pretty fun.
